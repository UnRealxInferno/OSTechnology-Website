# OS Technology

Static site for [ostechnology.uk](https://ostechnology.uk), served by IIS. Routing,
MIME types, caching and security headers all live in `web.config`.

## Markdown for agents

Every page has a markdown twin next to it (`about.html` → `about.md`) holding the
same content as clean, formatting-stripped text. AI agents and other clients can
reach it two ways:

- send `Accept: text/markdown` to the normal page URL — `web.config` rewrites the
  request to the `.md` file and responds `text/markdown; charset=utf-8`
- request the `.md` URL directly, e.g. `https://ostechnology.uk/about.md`

Browsers send `Accept: text/html,...`, never match the negotiation rules, and keep
getting HTML. Because one URL now has two representations, page responses carry
`Vary: Accept`.

The markdown is generated, not hand-written. After editing any page, regenerate it:

```sh
pip install beautifulsoup4 html2text
python3 tools/generate-markdown.py
```

`python3 tools/generate-markdown.py --check` verifies the committed `.md` files
match the HTML without writing anything, and exits non-zero if any are stale.
